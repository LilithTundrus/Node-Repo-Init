# Node Repo Init

A small script to assist with creating a new Node.js
repository. Basic, simple, to the point and **not** needlessly written in JS


## Usage

Run this shell script like any other script.

First, modify the script to be executable: 

```shell
chmod +x initrepo.sh
```

Then, run the script:

```
./initrepo.sh
```

Follow the steps for NPM init after all files have been created and you're ready
to go!
